# Resources

## History and Culture

- [The Bjarne Stroustrup homepage]
  (http://www.stroustrup.com)  
  Because Bjarne Stroustrup invented C++, and knows quite a bit about it

- [So what *did* Alan Kay really mean by the term “object-oriented”?]
  (http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/58732)  
  Alan Kay on the definition of "object-oriented programming"


## Technical Reference

- [The C++ Programming Language]
  (https://isocpp.org)  
  Links to the C++ standard, and the C++ Super-FAQ

- [cplusplus.com]
  (http://www.cplusplus.com)  
  Good page for general C++ information, tutorials, reference, etc.

- [C++ Reference]
  (http://en.cppreference.com/w/)  
  Probably slightly better than <cplusplus.com> as a technical reference,
  though <cplusplus.com> does tend to have better examples

- [cdecl]
  (http://cdecl.org)  
  Helpful with understanding C style type declarations


## Technical Notes

- [Is "inline" implicit in C++ member functions defined in class definition]
  (http://stackoverflow.com/a/9192199)  
  About the `inline` keyword, and the ODR (One Definition Rule)

- [Are pointers and arrays equivalent in C?]
  (http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/10/21/are-pointers-and-arrays-equivalent-in-c)

## Software

- [Linux Mint]
  (http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)  
  Because Linux is better, freer, and easier (especially for programming, once
  you get used to it) than Windows.  I recommend the Cinnamon version.

- [Visual Studio Community]
  (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)  
  A free (and I think fully feaatured?) version of Visual Studio

- [Microsoft DreamSpark]
  (https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/)  
  Free Microsoft software (for students, at least).  Though, I'm not sure why
  that's helpful.  It used to be more so.

  (http://www.fullerton.edu/IT/students/software/)  
  Which you for sure already know about :)
