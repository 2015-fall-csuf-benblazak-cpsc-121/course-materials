/**
 * Notes:
 *
 * - In the expression `int * p = &i;`, `*` is part of the type; it is not an
 *   operator.
 *
 * - In the expression `*p = 5;`, `*` is an operator.  This operator happens to
 *   modify the type of its operand (taking `p`, which is of type `int *`, and
 *   returning a variable of type `int`) but this statement does not contain
 *   any type cast, and `*` is not in this case describing any type.
 *
 * - Similarly, in the expression `int & p = i;`, `&` is part of the type; it
 *   is not an operator.
 *
 * - In the expression `int * p = &i;`, `&` is an operator.  This operator
 *   happens to modify the type of its operand (taking `i`, which is of type
 *   `int`, and returning a value of type `int *`) but this statement does not
 *   contain any type cast, and `&` is not in this case describing any type.
 *
 * - As operators, `*` and `&` are opposites.
 *
 * - As a part of a type declaration, `*` and `&` mean fairly different things,
 *   and it doesn't quite feel right to me to call them opposites.
 *
 * - Finally, for completeness, note that `*` is also the multiplication
 *   operator (as in the statement `int i = 4 * 5;`), and that `&` is also the
 *   "bitwise and" operator (as in the statement `int i = 4 & 5;`) (which you
 *   can read about on your own if you like, preferably after the midterm; we
 *   probably won't need it in this class).
