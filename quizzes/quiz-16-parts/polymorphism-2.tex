Show the output of the following program:
\evaluateCodeTop{polymorphism-2}{all}
\vspace{3ex}

What (if anything) is wrong with the code that is commented out above?
\textAnswer{\par
  It is possible to have a pointer of type superclass pointing to an object of
  type subclass, but not the other way around.  This makes sense because a
  child class will always have the same members as its parent (though, not
  always with the same access specifiers), but the reverse is rarely true.
  Also, conceptually, a \mintinline{cpp}{SmallDog} is always a
  \mintinline{cpp}{Dog}, so we may treat it as one; but a \mintinline{cpp}{Dog}
  will not always be a \mintinline{cpp}{SmallDog}, and it would be a mistake to
  assume we could treat all \mintinline{cpp}{Dog}s as
  \mintinline{cpp}{SmallDog}s.
